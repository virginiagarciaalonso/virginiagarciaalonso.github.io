    "text": "I was born in Mendoza (well known for its Malbec wine üç∑) and lived in three other provinces of Argentina. Regardless of my location, I have always been fascinated by animals and nature around me, especially at the sea üåä.\nI decided to study Biological Sciences at the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences (FCEN) of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), which basically became my home.\nAfter years studying and drinking lots of mates üßâ, I obtained my Bachelors Degree defending my Graduate Thesis (equivalent to a Master‚Äôs Thesis) on Antarctic Chaetognaths ‚Äîsome really cool marine invertebrates with hooks on their heads.\nI then pursued a Doctoral degree at the UBA. Financed by fellowships awarded by the UBA and the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), I studied early life stages of Fuegian sprat üêü in Argentina¬¥s first Marine Protected Area. As part of the research project, I was able to board a research vessel for more than 30 days (twice!) and work with researchers from various disciplines in the middle of the sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the most amazing sunsets I have ever seen ocurred during the cruises to the Marine Protected Area Namuncur√° at Burdwood Bank (Argentina).\n\n\nI extended my research on Fuegian sprat during a Postdoctoral fellowship while working as a Part-time Lecturer of Biostatistics at the UBA.\nDuring my last years of the PhD I got involved with the R-Ladies Buenos Aires chapter, first as an attendant to their meetings, and then as an organizer. This experience was so positive and enriching that it led me to get involved with many other amazing communities of practice. So, besides my passion for marine sciences, I became an advocate for open science practices."

    "text": "Spatiotemporal distribution and connectivity patterns\nThe distribution patterns of fish early life stages are critical to recruitment success and closely related to major oceanographic circulation patterns, reason why we explored the spatio-temporal distribution of early life stages of Fuegian sprat in all of the surveys.\nResults revealed significant seasonal fluctuations in abundance, distribution, and ontogenetic composition across habitats. High egg and early larval abundances at Isla de los Estados (IE) suggested it as an additional spawning ground to those previously identified at TDF and BB. However, only the latter appeared to be suitable nursery areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then conducted particle-tracking simulations based on egg abundance and spawning dates for the first time using results from a high-resolution hydrodynamic model.\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle transport provided evidence of connectivity between IE and neighbouring areas‚Äîenhanced when horizontal diffusivity is incorporated into the model‚Äîbut not between TDF and BB.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulated distributions closely resembled empirical patterns from this and other studies, allowing the integration of empirical and modelled data to schematize the species‚Äô dispersal pathways in the study area.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results offered new insights into distribution and connectivity patterns among spawning grounds and highlighted the potential use of hydrodynamic models for future assessments of Fuegian sprat and other planktonic species‚Äô dispersal and recruitment in the SWAO.\n\nGarc√≠a Alonso VA, Franco BC, Palma ED, P√°jaro M, Capitanio FL Integration of empirical and modelled data unravels spatiotemporal distribution and connectivity patterns of Fuegian sprat early life stages Mar Ecol Prog Ser :MFCav9. https://doi.org/10.3354/meps14329"

    "text": "I was motivated by all the communities of practice I know and by the generous individuals who are part of them to share as much as I can and grow collectively. So, I embarked on the journey to create a website as a platform to do so.\nI knew it was possible to use RStudio (an environment I am confortoble with) to create a website and GitHub to deploy it, although many also do it via Netlify. Choosing a site generator was the last thing missing. I came across many sites built with Hugo or Jekyll. I definitely recommend checking out this list of RLadies blogs for some inspiration. I finally decided to use Quarto after reading this blog post from Silvia Canel√≥n.\nThere are many options on how to build and deploy a website, and there is not a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù choice, but rather ‚Äúa choice that better suits you‚Äù.\nThere are VERY GOOD guidelines and examples already out there, so here‚Äôs a list of the persons and resources I turned to in case you want to build your site with Quarto. And there are some extra comments and tips from my experience at the end that may also be helpful ;)"

    "text": "I have crossed roads with incredible communities (and the people behind them!) which promote gender diversity, inclusivity, and the implementation of open science practices along among other valuable missions.\nHere are some of the many communities out there to which I‚Äôve joined, in case they can be useful to you too!\n\nR-Ladies\nR-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity within the R community in the quest to improve accessibility and inclusion.\nI first heard of R-Ladies from Laura Aci√≥n during an undergraduate course of Biostatistics at the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires. This was the first time I ever became aware of the existence of such communities and joining the Buenos Aires chapter was a life-changing experience.\nThere are chapters all around the world and they hold on-site and/or online events in which people can share their R codes, new packages, and so many other things. Above all, the community is a safe and really welcoming space for under-represented gender minorities (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender).\nYou can look for local chapters in the R-Ladies website or join the Community Slack.\n\n\nThe Carpentries\nThe Carpentries is a community formed by instructors, trainers, maintainers, helpers, and supporters that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.\nThe project comprises the Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry workshops with open and free lessons of many useful topics.\nYou can also become an Instructure and organize workshops!\n\n\nMetadocencia\nMetadocencia is a community that works to make the production, communication, and application of scientific and technical knowledge equitable globally.\nThey do remote and free courses intended for Spanish-speaking teachers and pay particular attention in teaching how to make inclusive content and activities.\n\n\nLatinR\nLatinR is a Latin American Conference on the Use of R in Research + Development.\nBesides holding on-site or online conferences, the community also has a Slack with channels to ask for help with coding issues or with preparing talks for this and other R conferences (including helping with translations for international conferences)\n\n\nR for Data Science\nThis is actually a book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund that teaches you how to do data science with R. But a Data Science Learning Community was built around it, with a Slack where people can ask for help, share job opportunities, advertise R-related events and more.\n\n\nOpen Life Science\nOpen Life Science is a not-for profit organization dedicated to capacity building and diversifying leadership in research worldwide. Theys strive for a future where research is accessible, inclusive, and equitable for everyone.\nThey provide the Open Seeds program for people interested in applying open principles in their work and becoming Open Science ambassadors in their communities.\n\n\nOceanHackWeek\nOceanHackWeek is a 5-day collaborative learning experience aimed at exploring, creating and promoting effective computation and analysis workflows for large and complex oceanographic data. It includes tutorials, data exploration, software development, collaborative projects and community networking.\nThere is also a Slack channel for participants and mentors to exchange questions, events, and job opportunities.\n\n\nRSpatial_ES\nRSpatial_ES is the Spanish speaking community of R users dedicated to spatial analysis and related aspects. They embarked on the experience of translating knowledge into the Spanish language and making it accessible mainly in Latin America. Members have access to community support, information and news about R and Rspatial tutorials, talks and courses, and contributions and reviews of their developments.\nThe community started and is maintained as a Telegram group.\n\n\nThe Turing Way\nThe Turing Way is an open source, open collaboration, and community-driven project. They are involved and support a diverse community of contributors to make data science accessible, comprehensible and effective for everyone. Their goal is to provide all the information that researchers and data scientists in academia, industry and the public sector need to ensure that the projects they work on are easy to reproduce and reuse.\nYou can join their Slack Workspace to connect and discuss ideas or suggestions with The Turing Way members."

    "text": "The idea\nMy first encounter with logo/identity design was when I took on the challenge of designing the new logo for the R-Ladies Buenos Aires chapter. During the creative process, we brainstormed with the other organizers, seeking to capture features that represent the City of Buenos Aires and embody the spirit of R-Ladies.\nAfter careful consideration, we chose the Floralis Gen√©rica, a sculpture located in the United Nations Square. Created by Eduardo Catalano in 2002, the sculpture pays homage to flowers üå∑ and reflects the dynamism of our times with its movement. In the flower, we found a beautiful analogy to the sense of community, where the different petals/persons are part of a structure surrounding something valuable. And, like the petals, we are also in constant movment towards increasing gender inclusion and gender diversity in the R community.\n\n\n\nThe process\nThe process involved several steps, both in the design of the flower and the hex. The first thing to do was drawing all the contours of the flower in different colors according to the different structures. Then, some outlines were removed, simplifying the structure. The final steps included filling the contours in different shades of violet and, lastly, removing the otlines for a simpler image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps involved in the process of the Floralis drawing.\n\nLastly, we had to decide the postion of the Floralis and the text in the logo. This also was quite a challenge since tehre were so many options!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the MANY options of logos created.\n\n\n\n\nThe final logo\nAfter careful consideration, we decided to portray the flower coming from the side, paired with a simple and stylish font style. We were really excited with the final outcome!e!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new logo for the R-Ladies Buenos Aires chapter."
