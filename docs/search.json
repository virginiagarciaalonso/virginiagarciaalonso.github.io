    "text": "Spatiotemporal distribution and connectivity patterns\nThe distribution patterns of fish early life stages are critical to recruitment success and closely related to major oceanographic circulation patterns, reason why we explored the spatio-temporal distribution of early life stages of Fuegian sprat in all of the surveys.\nResults revealed significant seasonal fluctuations in abundance, distribution, and ontogenetic composition across habitats. High egg and early larval abundances at Isla de los Estados (IE) suggested it as an additional spawning ground to those previously identified at TDF and BB. However, only the latter appeared to be suitable nursery areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then conducted particle-tracking simulations based on egg abundance and spawning dates for the first time using results from a high-resolution hydrodynamic model.\n\n\n\n\n\nParticle transport provided evidence of connectivity between IE and neighboring areas—enhanced when horizontal diffusivity is incorporated into the model—but not between TDF and BB.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulated distributions closely resembled empirical patterns from this and other studies, allowing the integration of empirical and modelled data to schematize the species’ dispersal pathways in the study area.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese results offered new insights into distribution and connectivity patterns among spawning grounds and highlighted the potential use of hydrodynamic models for future assessments of Fuegian sprat and other planktonic species’ dispersal and recruitment in the SWAO.\n\nGarcía Alonso VA, Franco BC, Palma ED, Pájaro M, Capitanio FL Integration of empirical and modelled data unravels spatiotemporal distribution and connectivity patterns of Fuegian sprat early life stages Mar Ecol Prog Ser :MFCav9. https://doi.org/10.3354/meps14329"

So, I embarked on the journey to create a website as a platform to do so.\nI knew it was possible to use RStudio (an environment I am comfortoble with) to create a website and GitHub to deploy it, although many also do it via Netlify. Choosing a site generator was the last thing missing. I came across many sites built with Hugo or Jekyll. I definitely recommend checking out this list of RLadies blogs for some inspiration. I finally decided to use Quarto after reading this blog post from Silvia Canelón.\nThere are many options on how to build and deploy a website, and there is not a “correct” choice, but rather “a choice that better suits you”.\nThere are VERY GOOD guidelines and examples already out there, so here’s a list of the persons and resources I turned to in case you want to build your site with Quarto. And there are some extra comments and tips from my experience at the end that may also be helpful ;)"

    "text": "I was born in Mendoza (well known for its Malbec wine 🍷) and lived in three other provinces of Argentina. Regardless of my location, I have always been fascinated by animals and nature around me, especially at the sea 🌊.\nI decided to study Biological Sciences at the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences (FCEN) of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), which basically became my home.\nAfter years studying and drinking lots of mates 🧉, I obtained my Bachelors Degree defending my Graduate Thesis (equivalent to a Master’s Thesis) on Antarctic Chaetognaths —some really cool marine invertebrates with hooks on their heads.\nI then pursued a Doctoral degree at the UBA. Financed by fellowships awarded by the UBA and the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), I studied early life stages of Fuegian sprat 🐟 in Argentina´s first Marine Protected Area. As part of the research project, I was able to board a research vessel for more than 30 days (twice!) and work with researchers from various disciplines in the middle of the sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the most amazing sunsets I have ever seen occurred during the cruises to the Marine Protected Area Namuncurá at Burdwood Bank (Argentina).\n\n\nI extended my research on Fuegian sprat during a Postdoctoral fellowship while working as a Part-time Lecturer of Biostatistics at the UBA.\nDuring my last years of the PhD I got involved with the R-Ladies Buenos Aires chapter, first as an attendant to their meetings, and then as an organizer. This experience was so positive and enriching that it led me to get involved with many other amazing communities of practice. So, besides my passion for marine sciences, I became an advocate for open science practices and I embarked in the creation of a new community by and for marine early career researchers from Latin America (JICMar) (for the sylabus in Spanish)."

    "text": "The idea\nMy first encounter with logo/identity design was when I took on the challenge of designing the new logo for the R-Ladies Buenos Aires chapter. During the creative process, we brainstormed with the other organizers, seeking to capture features that represent the City of Buenos Aires and embody the spirit of R-Ladies.\nAfter careful consideration, we chose the Floralis Genérica, a sculpture located in the United Nations Square. Created by Eduardo Catalano in 2002, the sculpture pays homage to flowers 🌷 and reflects the dynamism of our times with its movement. In the flower, we found a beautiful analogy to the sense of community, where the different petals/persons are part of a structure surrounding something valuable. And, like the petals, we are also in constant movement towards increasing gender inclusion and gender diversity in the R community.\n\n\n\nThe process\nThe process involved several steps, both in the design of the flower and the hex. The first thing to do was drawing all the contours of the flower in different colors according to the different structures. Then, some outlines were removed, simplifying the structure. The final steps included filling the contours in different shades of violet and, lastly, removing the outlines for a simpler image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps involved in the process of the Floralis drawing.\n\nLastly, we had to decide the position of the Floralis and the text in the logo. This also was quite a challenge since there were so many options!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the MANY options of logos created.\n\n\n\n\nThe final logo\nAfter careful consideration, we decided to portray the flower coming from the side, paired with a simple and stylish font style.
